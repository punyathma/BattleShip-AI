Abstract
This project report presents an algorithm designed to generate and solve Battleship game
grids. By programmatically placing ships on a grid and systematically solving it, this project
demonstrates an intersection of game theory, algorithm development, and problem-solving in a
simulated environment. The results showcase the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of hit ratio
and the number of cells checked.
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
The game of Battleship is a classic naval strategy game where players place ships on a grid and take turns
guessing the locations of the opponent’s ships. This project digitizes a part of this experience by implementing
an algorithm that not only generates these grids but also solves them.
1.2 Objective
The primary aim is to create a Python-based solution that can autonomously generate a Battleship grid with
ships placed in random orientations and positions, and then solve this grid by identifying the locations of all
ships.
1.3 Significance
Understanding the algorithmic approach to such a problem can have broader implications in understanding
computational problem-solving, offering insights into efficient algorithm design and strategic thinking.
2 Methodology
2.1 Grid Generation
The ‘create battleship grid(size=10)‘ function initializes a 10x10 grid and randomly places five types of ships
on it. Each ship is defined by its size and type, such as the 5-cell Aircraft Carrier or the 2-cell Destroyer. The
function ensures no overlap or out-of-bound placements.
2.2 Grid Solving
The ‘solve battleship(grid)‘ function systematically checks each cell of the grid. It marks hits when a ship part
is found and misses otherwise. The process continues until all ship parts are hit, keeping track of the number
of attempts made.
3 Results
A sample generated grid was successfully populated with all ships randomly placed. The solver algorithm
managed to identify all ship locations. It achieved a hit ratio of approximately 17% (17 hits out of 100 cells),
with 83 misses. The systematic approach ensured that no cell was checked more than once.

4 Discussion
4.1 Algorithm Efficiency
The algorithm efficiently solves any given Battleship grid. However, it follows a brute-force approach, checking
each cell without any strategic inference from previous hits.
4.2 Potential Improvements
Future improvements could include implementing a more intelligent hit-follow-up strategy, potentially reducing
the number of checks required to solve the grid.
5 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates an algorithmic approach to generating and solving Battleship grids.
It reflects the potential of simple algorithms in solving complex problems and lays the groundwork for more
sophisticated problem-solving strategies in similar contexts.

7 Appendix: Source Code
7.1 Battleship Grid Generator and Solver
The following Python script includes two main functions: ‘create battleship grid‘, which generates a 10x10 grid
with battleships placed randomly, and ‘solve battleship‘, which systematically checks each cell to find and hit

Note: The code includes random ship placement and a systematic approach to solve the generated grid. The
grid solver iterates through each cell, marking hits and misses, until all ships are found.
